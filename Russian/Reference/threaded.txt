@Title Threaded

@Syntax

  @Keyword Threaded[.<type>] <variable[.<type>]> [= <constant expression>] [, ...]

@Description

  @Keyword Threaded allows to create a @LibraryLink "thread" "thread based" persistent @ReferenceLink "variables" "variable",
  @ReferenceLink "dim" "arrays" (except multi-dimensional arrays), @ReferenceLink "newlist" "lists" or @ReferenceLink "newmap" "maps". This means
  every @LibraryLink "thread" "thread" will have its own version of the object. This is only useful when writing multithreaded programs.
  If a type is specified after @Keyword Threaded, the default type is changed for this declaration. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  Each variable can have a default value directly assigned to it, but it has to be a constant value.
  When declaring a threaded array, the dimension parameter has to be a constant value. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  A Threaded object can't be declared in a procedure, its scope is always global.


@Example With variables

@Code
  Threaded Counter
  
  Counter = 128
  
  Procedure Thread(Parameter)
    
    Debug Counter ; Will display zero as this thread doesn't have used this variable for now
    Counter = 256
    Debug Counter ; Will display 256
    
  EndProcedure
  
  Thread = CreateThread(@Thread(), 0)
  WaitThread(Thread) ; Wait for thread ending
  
  Debug Counter ; Will display 128, even if Counter has been changed in the thread
@EndCode
